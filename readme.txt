== Description ==

[Jomres](http://www.jomres.net) is a hotel/villa booking system and portal for Joomla and Wordpress. Developed for over 9 years, it's Joomla favourite, and most powerful hotel and villa booking system, and is now available for integration into Wordpress sites.

This plugin contains the bridging plugins required to run Jomres in Wordpress.


= About Jomres =

Jomres is Joomla's longest running Hotel Booking System/Booking portal. GPL licensed and going strong for 9 years, after many requests we've finally modified it to integrate it into Wordpress. The core system is free and is a working booking system which can be enhanced with plugins that can be downloaded through the Jomres Plugin Manager once you have purchased a Download and Support license.

Typically used for renting out rooms in hotels, villas, apartments etc, we've seen it used for everything from golf courses to cars and even tool hire and billboards. 

Jomres is NOT a booking calendar. It's a full booking portal with a variety of search features, monetisation options and more bells and whistles than we can count. Ajax driven throughout, Jomres 8 has been developed under consulation with hoteliers to provide the most userfriendly UX possible.

Jomres has different language files for different property types, so you can mix and match property types on the same installation. Fully multilingual, it uses it's own language translation functionality. This functionality has been developed in such a way that is upgrade safe. Customisation is a breeze.

The system has been built with the mindset that the data you create is yours, and nobody elses. Jomres is not a SAAS/cloud based system where you pay a monthly fee and the availability is subject to the profitability (or otherwise) of a hosting service. Once it's downloaded and installed it's yours to use for the lifetime of your project.

It has historically been written for use in the Joomla Content Management System. We chose to integrate with a CMS because this significantly improves the flexability availabile to our users with respect to how they can customise their sites. Version 8.1 introduces the ability for users to install not only on Joomla, but also into Wordpress. This means that we are able to provide Wordpress users with a tried and tested booking system without them needing to learn a new CMS.

= New in Jomres 8.1 =

* **Wordpress integration** Run Jomres within Wordpress.
* **Booking approvals** Approve/Reject bookings before taking payment online.
* **Email template editing** Property Managers can edit email templates easily in the frontend.
* **Budget** Users are able to set a Budget option in the Property list pages, showing them properties that are within a given budget (the surrounding panel turns green). Bootstrapped templates only.


= Features =

Some extra [Jomres plugins](http://manual.jomres.net/core_plugins.html?ms=BQBAAAAAAAASQAg=&mw=MjQw&st=MA==&sct=MA==) may be needed to access all features.


* **Secure booking portal** Designed from the ground up to be a secure booking portal. Invite property managers to list their properties with you, monetising their involvement through subscription plans, commission fees or both.
* **Responsive** Using responsive templates, we were the first Joomla & Wordpress Booking system to adopt Bootstrap 2, offering a solution even before Joomla 3 was released. Jomres 8 is compatible with Bootstrap 3, which delivers a sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile first front-end framework to your clients. Another first, where we lead, others are sure to follow.
* **Well documented** With a complete manual and integrated help system we aim to guide you every step of the way.
* **Powerful booking engine** Take deposit payments online through your own Joomla & Wordpress Hotel Booking System. No need to pay somebody else commission! It has a powerful booking engine, making it the most flexible Joomla & Wordpress Hotel Booking System available. Ajax driven, we were among the very first booking systems to utilise this technology and have built extensively on this solid foundation ever since.
* **Open forum for all** Large, active community forum with thousands of members.
* **Modular** The heart of Jomres is modular in design. This approach makes Jomres extremely friendly to third party developers, who we work closely with to ensure that the entire community can add to the system's functionality. This means, even if the system doesn't have a feature you might want it's easy to add new functionality without having to edit the core.
* **Paypal** Paypal support by default, take payments online within minutes. If you are offering a portal you can either choose to take all payments yourself or hotels can take payments through their own accounts and you raise separate commission or subscription invoices. [Jomres partners](http://www.jomres.net/support-mainmenu-209/partners) have also built their own payment gateways, meaning you're not just limited to just Paypal.
* **Search** A large number of different search features are available to add some sparkle to your site and help guide your guests to the property of their choice. Choose from the ubiquitous ajax search to the more exciting "Lucky Dip" plugin.
* **Dashboard** Dynamic, ajax driven Dashboard displays relevent information clearly and cleanly.
* **Easy tariff editing** Choose the tariff editing mode that suits your situation. Use the Normal mode for simple pricing that's valid for the next 10 years...
* **Total control over pricing** ...or the Micromanage mode that allows you total control over pricing and minimum stay lengths.
* **Discounts** Multiple discount features available including coupon codes, partner discounts and personal discounts for guests. QR codes that link direct to the booking form can be printed as part of your promotional material.
* **Customisation** Jomres offers a veritable feast of different ways to customise the system. From Property type specific templates and language files, property specific labels to full-on integration with Microsoft's translation software, there's something here for every level of user.
* **Image uploads** The media centre makes it easy for you to upload, view and delete images for the property, it's slideshow and even for individual rooms.
* **Optional extras** Optional extras can be added easily to a booking. Create a simple extra which can use a number of different pricing models (such as "per booking" or "per day") or if you want to offer finite resources (such as tours or a table in the restraunt) you can opt to use the more extensive Jintour plugin.
* **Simple User Interface** Property details are shown on one page, with an easy to navigate UI, tabbed information pages, google maps and slideshow.
* **Booking Creation Kit** Jomres is a Booking System Creation Kit. Whilst it is designed to work "out of the box" with minimal configuration, it's real strength comes from the power and flexability of it's plugin functionality. Don't offer another cookie-cutter booking site, be creative and innovate, using Jomres as the foundation you can build upon.


= Phoning home =

Note that the Jomres system has to phone home to perform certain actions, for example to find the current version of the system and current versions of plugins, download plugins (if you have a valid license to do so), get latest news etc. It also contacts remote services to find geo-location information, Google maps and currency conversion data. Installation of Jomres and use of it's functionality assumes that you agree that it does this. We don't collect data about you unless you install a Jomres plugin, and then only so that we can ensure that only authorised users can install said plugin.


== Installation ==

This plugin contains only the bridging software required to allow Jomres and Wordpress to work together. To comply with Wordpress plugin directory rules we are unable to include the web installation package, however you can download it for free from [our downloads page](http://www.jomres.net/files/jomres_booking_system_web_installer_for_wordpress.zip).

1. Unzip jomres_booking_system_web_installer_for_wordpress.zip
2. Go to Plugins -> Add new and upload `jomres.zip`.
3. If Jomres isn't yet installed you will see a message saying so and you'll be given a link to follow to download the [Jomres Wordpress Web Installer](http://www.jomres.net/files/jomres_booking_system_web_installer_for_wordpress.zip). You must install this as this installs the actual Jomres Core system.
4. Activate the Jomres Wordpress Web Installer through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. This will copy jomres_webinstall.php to the root of your Wordpress installation.
5. Follow the [onscreen instructions](http://manual.jomres.net/step_1___web_installer__recommended_.html?ms=AwAAAAAAAAAKIA==&mw=MjQw&st=MA==&sct=MA==) to download Jomres and install it. Once Jomres has been installed please deactivate and delete the *Jomres Booking System Web Installer for Wordpress*.

Jomres Core is free as in beer. If you want to enhance it's functionality through some of the many available plugins, or want support for it we encourage you to investigate the services we offer, but Jomres Core is free and not crippled in any way.

We do not collect information about you or your server. All Jomres code is provided Open Source.

== Translations ==

* Jomres includes 31 language files in varying states of translation as we rely on members to feed back their versions of the language files. It includes a [variety of methods for translation](http://manual.jomres.net/editing_labels___languages.html?ms=EQAACAAAAABCQEA=&mw=MjQw&st=MA==&sct=MA==) allowing you to have different labels for different property types, and even individual properties.

*Note:* If you would like to contribute a language file back to the project please email us at sales@jomres.net, typically an update to a language file will earn you between 1-6 months added to your license, depending on the amount of translation that was required to bring the language file up-to-date.

== Additional Info ==

Upgrades are best performed through the Jomres Updates menu option in the administrator area.

== Post Installation recommendations ==

Jomres is primarily developed against Joomla version 3.x. This means that we are huge fans of Twitter Bootstrap. It's clean, responsive and built into Joomla from the get-go.

Jomres comes with it's own layout templates, and there are three sets of these templates : jQuery UI, Bootstrap 2 and Bootstrap 3. By default, when Jomres is installed into Wordpress it will choose to use the jQuery UI templates. These are a reasonable compromise bearing in mind that it's impossible to make a set of templates that work perfectly with all CMS templates, however in our experience we've found it advantagous to install a Bootstrap 2 or Bootstrap 3 Wordpress template as soon as we create a new Wordpress installation.

We recommend that the first thing you do is find a Bootstrap 2 or 3 Wordpress template that you like and install that on your site. Next, go to Jomres' Site Configuration area and set "Use Jomres Bootstrap templates in the frontend?" to Yes and set "Bootstrap version" to Bootstrap 2 or 3.

This will ensure that your WP template and the Jomres templates play nicely together. The administrator area of Wordpress will still use the jQuery UI based templates, but the public facing pages will use Bootstrap.
