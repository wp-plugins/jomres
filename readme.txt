== Description ==

[Jomres](http://www.jomres.net) is a hotel/villa booking system and portal for Joomla and Wordpress. Developed for over 9 years, it's Joomla favourite, and most powerful hotel and villa booking system, and is now available for integration into Wordpress sites.

This plugin contains the bridging plugins required to run Jomres in Wordpress.


= About Jomres =

Jomres is Joomla's longest running Hotel Booking System/Booking portal. GPL licensed and going strong for 9 years, after many requests we've finally modified it to integrate it into Wordpress. The core system is free and is a working booking system which can be enhanced with plugins that can be downloaded through the Jomres Plugin Manager once you have purchased a Download and Support license.

Typically used for renting out rooms in hotels, villas, apartments etc, we've seen it used for everything from golf courses to cars and even tool hire and billboards. 

Jomres is NOT a booking calendar. It's a full booking portal with a variety of search features, monetisation options and more bells and whistles than we can count. Ajax driven throughout, Jomres 8 has been developed under consulation with hoteliers to provide the most userfriendly UX possible.

Jomres has different language files for different property types, so you can mix and match property types on the same installation. Fully multilingual, it uses it's own language translation functionality. This functionality has been developed in such a way that is upgrade safe. Customisation is a breeze.

The system has been built with the mindset that the data you create is yours, and nobody elses. Jomres is not a SAAS/cloud based system where you pay a monthly fee and the availability is subject to the profitability (or otherwise) of a hosting service. Once it's downloaded and installed it's yours to use for the lifetime of your project.

It has historically been written for use in the Joomla Content Management System. We chose to integrate with a CMS because this significantly improves the flexability availabile to our users with respect to how they can customise their sites. Version 8.1 introduces the ability for users to install not only on Joomla, but also into Wordpress. This means that we are able to provide Wordpress users with a tried and tested booking system without them needing to learn a new CMS.

= New in Jomres 8.1 =

* **Wordpress integration** Run Jomres within Wordpress.
* **Booking approvals** Approve/Reject bookings before taking payment online.
* **Email template editing** Property Managers can edit email templates easily in the frontend.
* **Budget** Users are able to set a Budget option in the Property list pages, showing them properties that are within a given budget (the surrounding panel turns green). Bootstrapped templates only.


= Features =

Some extra [Jomres plugins](http://manual.jomres.net/core_plugins.html?ms=BQBAAAAAAAASQAg=&mw=MjQw&st=MA==&sct=MA==) may be needed to access all features.


* **Secure booking portal** Designed from the ground up to be a secure booking portal. Invite property managers to list their properties with you, monetising their involvement through subscription plans, commission fees or both.
* **Responsive** Using responsive templates, we were the first Joomla & Wordpress Booking system to adopt Bootstrap 2, offering a solution even before Joomla 3 was released. Jomres 8 is compatible with Bootstrap 3, which delivers a sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile first front-end framework to your clients. Another first, where we lead, others are sure to follow.
* **Well documented** With a complete manual and integrated help system we aim to guide you every step of the way.
* **Powerful booking engine** Take deposit payments online through your own Joomla & Wordpress Hotel Booking System. No need to pay somebody else commission! It has a powerful booking engine, making it the most flexible Joomla & Wordpress Hotel Booking System available. Ajax driven, we were among the very first booking systems to utilise this technology and have built extensively on this solid foundation ever since.
* **Open forum for all** Large, active community forum with thousands of members.
* **Modular** The heart of Jomres is modular in design. This approach makes Jomres extremely friendly to third party developers, who we work closely with to ensure that the entire community can add to the system's functionality. This means, even if the system doesn't have a feature you might want it's easy to add new functionality without having to edit the core.
* **Paypal** Paypal support by default, take payments online within minutes. If you are offering a portal you can either choose to take all payments yourself or hotels can take payments through their own accounts and you raise separate commission or subscription invoices. [Jomres partners](http://www.jomres.net/support-mainmenu-209/partners) have also built their own payment gateways, meaning you're not just limited to just Paypal.
* **Search** A large number of different search features are available to add some sparkle to your site and help guide your guests to the property of their choice. Choose from the ubiquitous ajax search to the more exciting "Lucky Dip" plugin.
* **Dashboard** Dynamic, ajax driven Dashboard displays relevent information clearly and cleanly.
* **Easy tariff editing** Choose the tariff editing mode that suits your situation. Use the Normal mode for simple pricing that's valid for the next 10 years...
* **Total control over pricing** ...or the Micromanage mode that allows you total control over pricing and minimum stay lengths.
* **Discounts** Multiple discount features available including coupon codes, partner discounts and personal discounts for guests. QR codes that link direct to the booking form can be printed as part of your promotional material.
* **Customisation** Jomres offers a veritable feast of different ways to customise the system. From Property type specific templates and language files, property specific labels to full-on integration with Microsoft's translation software, there's something here for every level of user.
* **Image uploads** The media centre makes it easy for you to upload, view and delete images for the property, it's slideshow and even for individual rooms.
* **Optional extras** Optional extras can be added easily to a booking. Create a simple extra which can use a number of different pricing models (such as "per booking" or "per day") or if you want to offer finite resources (such as tours or a table in the restraunt) you can opt to use the more extensive Jintour plugin.
* **Simple User Interface** Property details are shown on one page, with an easy to navigate UI, tabbed information pages, google maps and slideshow.
* **Booking Creation Kit** Jomres is a Booking System Creation Kit. Whilst it is designed to work "out of the box" with minimal configuration, it's real strength comes from the power and flexability of it's plugin functionality. Don't offer another cookie-cutter booking site, be creative and innovate, using Jomres as the foundation you can build upon.


= Phoning home =

Note that the Jomres system has to phone home to perform certain actions, for example to find the current version of the system and current versions of plugins, download plugins (if you have a valid license to do so), get latest news etc. It also contacts remote services to find geo-location information, Google maps and currency conversion data. Installation of Jomres and use of it's functionality assumes that you agree that it does this. We don't collect data about you unless you install a Jomres plugin, and then only so that we can ensure that only authorised users can install said plugin.


== Installation ==

This plugin contains only the bridging software required to allow Jomres and Wordpress to work together. To comply with Wordpress plugin directory rules we are unable to include the web installation package, however you can download it for free from [our downloads page](http://www.jomres.net/files/jomres_booking_system_web_installer_for_wordpress.zip).

1. Unzip jomres_booking_system_web_installer_for_wordpress.zip
2. Go to Plugins -> Add new and upload `jomres.zip`.
3. If Jomres isn't yet installed you will see a message saying so and you'll be given a link to follow to download the [Jomres Wordpress Web Installer](http://www.jomres.net/files/jomres_booking_system_web_installer_for_wordpress.zip). You must install this as this installs the actual Jomres Core system.
4. Activate the Jomres Wordpress Web Installer through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. This will copy jomres_webinstall.php to the root of your Wordpress installation.
5. Follow the [onscreen instructions](http://manual.jomres.net/step_1___web_installer__recommended_.html?ms=AwAAAAAAAAAKIA==&mw=MjQw&st=MA==&sct=MA==) to download Jomres and install it. Once Jomres has been installed please deactivate and delete the *Jomres Booking System Web Installer for Wordpress*.

Jomres Core is free as in beer. If you want to enhance it's functionality through some of the many available plugins, or want support for it we encourage you to investigate the services we offer, but Jomres Core is free and not crippled in any way.

We do not collect information about you or your server. All Jomres code is provided Open Source.

Modified system to provide language strings for table tools (flash buttons cannot yet be translated).
Added new administrator area feature to show our Jomres Partners and their plugins.
Modified generateDateInput.php so that it will also recognise asc_arrivalDate to setup javascript that'll change the departure date automatic changes too. This (in a roundabout sort of way) allows us to use ajax search composite on pages that include the booking form. Previously having ASC on pages with the booking form, the booking engine could erroneously pull the arrival date from ajax search composite's form, potentially screwing with the booking engine's dates. We got around that previously by not showing ASC on pages that showed the booking form. Now, we don't need to do that.
Improved the BS2 flat property details template to add more output.
Polish lang file updated, thanks Patryk.

Restored a commented out setting in property config referring to minimum intervals.
Removed a class from the language dropdown that's no longer required.
Added new strings to lang files relevant to Instant v Deferred booking tags in property list.
Removed overlay snippet code that was added last version, it has been put back into the list properties due to other changes added because of changes being made to the demo.
Added reviews information for use in property details page, not just tabs.
Hardened media centre scripts against spambot intrusion.
Modified the booking form slightly so that the address details slide up/down when sufficient booking details are known, rather than simply fading in/out. This means that the initial booking form area on in flat property details template takes up less space.
Removed some un-needed template files.
Replaced some BS2 hidden classes with their corresponding BS3 classes in room type list.
Added code to allow automatic triggering of bootstrap tooltips on page load and binding to dynamic events.
Modified output price function so that if using bootstrap then original price (price in brackets) is now shown in a tooltip.
Changed Arrival and Departure strings to Check-in and Check-out in english language files.
Added Font Awesome as an optional css library. Many BS2 Joomla templates exclude glyph icons, or name the icons differently, meaning we can't always rely on a template to provide the required icons, so we'll add our own. Switchable because all BS3 joomla templates so far seem to include FA icon sets by default.
Modified the Booking Engine and Search functionality so that calendars now use calendar icons instead of the old calendar image. Makes styling much easier and looks neater.
The clear dates checkbox can now be added to a search template via {CLEARDATES_CHECKBOX} (and associated checkbox can be removed from the js_calendar_input.html template. This helps with styling.
Output price has been changed to use an icon instead of a link on the price to allow users to see the converted price.
Added a new optional trigger to listProperties.

Fixed BS3 edit property template to ensure previously selected features are checked.
Fixed an issue where review results could be incorrectly attributed.
Fixed a bug that prevented stars from showing in property list.
Fixed a bug where un-published properties could show in the agent's page.

Removed a stray </select> from the search generation code.
Added quick info output text to property module data script.
Removed some stray spaces from code that was upsetting adaptations of the JavaScript drop downs.

Implemented new code for searching by property name, thanks for the contribution Rod.
Added two new triggers for publishing properties ( 02273 for after a property has been successfully published and 02274 for when it has been unpublished ), at the request of a third party developer.

= Jomres 8.1.9 07/08/2014

<span class="label label-success">Feature</span> Added Japanese language file. Many thanks Jeff.

Improved icons in the BS3 media centre templates.
Updated a version number in an xml file.
Minor tweak to control panel to add the Date to the news output.
Updated Jomres' images to the new logo.
Added an option to use templates to build the currency conversion selector rather than plain old dropdowns, which allows us to add the dropdown to bootstrap toolbars.
Changed the name of the default property created on Jomres installation.

Fixed a misplaced bracket in patTemplate class. Thanks Maritn.
Changed how files are read into the js and css cache classes.
Tweaked how a disabled task's name is determined.


= Jomres 8.1.8 31/07/2014

<span class="label label-success">Feature</span> Refactored javascript and css file handling. Older method was growing to become clumsy, new process automatically creates consolidation scripts (where as many .js files as is practical are presented as one file) and .js and .css files are automatically minified. All new .js and .css files can be supplied un-minified, if the file is ever modifed the served, minified and/or consolidated version of that file is automatically updated.
<span class="label label-success">Feature</span> Updated dump template vars functionality (Site Configuration -> Debugging). Instead of using older patTemplate dump function we now output the name of the individual template and on hover the variables available to the template are shown. It's not pretty, but it makes it very easy for site integrators to identify Jomres template files that they may wish to modify.

Improved price overlay, added ability to switch it on and off, changed the output a little to use new strings and calculations based on how prices are stored.
Improved new functionality related to finding the number of days in the property list search results.
Added a trap to capture what looks like Bots attempting to access the booking form. As the bots can't use the booking engine they're going to the confirmation page without the property uid being set, so we'll redirect these back to the default Jomres page.
Added changes so that custom fields are viewable in show confirmation.
Reworked how the fullpage jomres.php file copying is performed so that it's only done when needed.

Changed how some urls are using in the booking form as they're better "built" and less likely to cause odd redirection behaviour on certain systems.
Fixed a z-index issue in the dashboard calendar.
Fixed a broken link to the ajax animation when live scrolling.

<span class="label label-info">Wordpress</span> Wordpress : Changed how javascript is queued in wp
<span class="label label-info">Wordpress</span> Changed how WP registers the bootstrap tour script so that it doesn't cause .js errors.
<span class="label label-info">Wordpress</span> Fixed a path in management view to the logo
<span class="label label-info">Wordpress</span> Added a check for the wp_jomres class in a function to prevent it from being run if we're outside a Jomres page.
<span class="label label-info">Wordpress</span> Updated the getting started notes to be a bit more relevant to WP users.

<span class="label label-info">Joomla</span> Modified the template reader script to allow Joomla overrides-esque functionality. 
Put templates from /jomres/templates/xxxx/frontend and /jomres/templates/xxxx/backend into /templates/templatename/html/com_jomres or /jomres/templates/xxx/admin into /administrator/templates/templatename/html/com_jomres to override the core Jomres templates.
Existing template editing functionality is retained, however a file placed into a com_jomres directory will override a customisation created using the template editing feature. If there is no file in com_jomres then existing customisations will still be used.
Advantage : People who're familiar with Joomla template overrides can use their favourite functionality still, however
Disadvantage : you cannot have different templates for different property types.


= Jomres 8.1.7 13/06/2014

<span class="label label-success">Feature</span> Added the calendar to the module popup contents.
<span class="label label-success">Feature</span> Added ability to view the changelog in administrator -> developer tools. Reformatted the changelog so that we can start making use of BS labels to make it more readable.
<span class="label label-success">Feature</span> Added a new image overlay tag to property list that shows the cumulative price calculated from the dates in ajax search's dates.

Prevent resources menu option from showing if is Jintour or real-estate property
Changed how currency codes are pulled for listing against invoices.
Changed how invoice creation is done when Booking Approvals are enabled.
Added a tweak to correctly use https if needed when initialising the live_site variable in Joomla.
Added a tweak to correctly use https if needed when initialising the live_site variable in Joomla 2.5
Tweaked detect_cms.php to only define JPATH_PLATFORM if it's not already defined.
Modified basic contract details so that country name is returned instead of country code. 
Added a new country_code array index to ensure that this is also available if needed, in line with basic_property_details functionality.
Added functionality to translate room types for SRPs.
Changed some "exits" to "thrown" errors.

== Translations ==

* Jomres includes 31 language files in varying states of translation as we rely on members to feed back their versions of the language files. It includes a [variety of methods for translation](http://manual.jomres.net/editing_labels___languages.html?ms=EQAACAAAAABCQEA=&mw=MjQw&st=MA==&sct=MA==) allowing you to have different labels for different property types, and even individual properties.

*Note:* If you would like to contribute a language file back to the project please email us at sales@jomres.net, typically an update to a language file will earn you between 1-6 months added to your license, depending on the amount of translation that was required to bring the language file up-to-date.

== Additional Info ==

Upgrades are best performed through the Jomres Updates menu option in the administrator area.

== Post Installation recommendations ==

Jomres is primarily developed against Joomla version 3.x. This means that we are huge fans of Twitter Bootstrap. It's clean, responsive and built into Joomla from the get-go.

Jomres comes with it's own layout templates, and there are three sets of these templates : jQuery UI, Bootstrap 2 and Bootstrap 3. By default, when Jomres is installed into Wordpress it will choose to use the jQuery UI templates. These are a reasonable compromise bearing in mind that it's impossible to make a set of templates that work perfectly with all CMS templates, however in our experience we've found it advantagous to install a Bootstrap 2 or Bootstrap 3 Wordpress template as soon as we create a new Wordpress installation.

We recommend that the first thing you do is find a Bootstrap 2 or 3 Wordpress template that you like and install that on your site. Next, go to Jomres' Site Configuration area and set "Use Jomres Bootstrap templates in the frontend?" to Yes and set "Bootstrap version" to Bootstrap 2 or 3.

This will ensure that your WP template and the Jomres templates play nicely together. The administrator area of Wordpress will still use the jQuery UI based templates, but the public facing pages will use Bootstrap.
